"""tests are a piece of code which make sure that other peices of code run smooth
principle is to break the code into smaller parts and to test that first
for example a class with 4 methods. we test each method with a piece of code
Python has 3 ways of making tests
1. unitest library - the most basic and usual
    built in to python
    import unittest
2. pytest library - also a framework
    it tests all the files with test_ in the name
3. doctest - uses the docstring to test
    def func():
    docstring in triple quotation marks
TDD (Test Driven Developement)
it is a philosophy for writing testing code
also known as Red-Green-Refractory
    code to fail
    code to pass
    refactoring
